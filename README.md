## Description

This project was made to show my skills that i have learned about coding during and outside of the boot camp and hopefully with some luck will gain me employment.
Ive had alot of fun so far testing and seeing how things work, despite what half of my commit messsages might say. HA, that was supposed to be funny..
Hopefully by the time this project is completed i will have a slightly more professional description.
This is also a work-in-progress, i used the tutorial mainly for learning purposes and just figured that if this was eventually going to be the website that gained me employment i wanted to get a head start.
I also plan to add features and statistics to this website as the course moves along.
On a side note i downloaded sass because of the benefits it has with nesting and its live update features so hopefully that is alright!
