## Description

This project was made to show my skills that i have learned about coding during and outside of the boot camp and hopefully with some luck will gain me employment.
Ive had alot of fun so far testing and seeing how things work, despite what half of my commit messsages might say. HA, that was supposed to be funny..
Hopefully by the time this projects completed i will have a slightly more professional description.
